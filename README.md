Live video streaming for remote navigation

Manual control via web interface (no need for external apps)

Pesticide spraying mechanism controlled remotely

Designed for small to medium-sized farming applications

ðŸ§  Technologies
ESP32-CAM (for video capture)

ESP32-WROOM (for server, motor, and sprayer control)

HTML + JavaScript interface hosted on ESP32

TCP communication between the two ESPs
